            <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
            <p>There is so much that I can say about myself that I dont know even where to start. I was born in Nairobi by loving parents who raised me in good morals and taught me to value other people's feelings and always behave appropriately. I joined
                kindergaten at the age of three and was always among the top until I completed my primary school. I later joined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_High_School_(Kenya)" target="blank">Alliance High School</a> for my secondary
                education. After my high school I worked at
                <a href="http://www.dalberg.com/" target="blank">Dalberg Global Development Advisors</a> for a few weeks afterwhich I later joined Moringa School. I am currently undertaking a course in coding. In future I would like to start my own engineering
                firm and I certainly would like to merge IT and engineering in order to solve more problems and make the world a better place to live in. I chose programming because it certainly will give me an edge above the rest in the field I opt to
                venture into not only in the limited market but also in the scarce resources available in the career world. The current world we are in is quite techno-modified in that everyone depends on technology for the day-to-day running of their
                mundane lives. Hence it is necessary to remain above the rest in terms of skill and expertise in something techno-related. </p>
